Example PAM module demonstrating two-factor authentication.

Build and install by running "make install".

Then add this line to your PAM configuration file:
  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

Run the "google-authenticator" binary to create a new secret key in your home
directory.

If your system supports the "libqrencode" library, you will be shown a QRCode
that you can scan using the Android "Google Authenticator" application.

If your system does not have this library, you have to manually enter the
alphanumeric secret key into the Android "Google Authenticator" application.

In either case, after you have added the key, click-and-hold until the context
menu shows. Then check that the key's verification value matches.

Each time you log into your system, you will now be prompted for your
TOTP code (timebased one-time-password) after having entered your normal user
id and your normal UNIX account password.
